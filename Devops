Why Devops?
  Example dev writes the code for an application and and client will use that application.
When devops was not evolved . Dev have to share the code to central location--> system admin will create server and tester would test it.
Build and release engineer would promote app to prod or staging/pre-prod
Simply.
Dev -- writes the code and share the code to central location
sys admin --> creates server(No cloud at this time of before 10years) and install the application 
BRE(Build release engineer) --> he deploys the app on to the server
Server Admin --> will create the app server
